                  <p>Terry is an autonomous home security system that utilises drone technology in conjunction with artifical intelligence to create the ultimate personal security guard for homeowners. The aim of Terry is to prevent potential burglaries by creating a presence in the home.</p>
                  <h5>How Does it Work?</h5>
                  <p>Terry works by connecting the homeowners alarm system, an autonomous drone and the Terry app to protect the home. Our concept works by using sound and audio to prevent potential burglaries by creating a presence in the home through an autonomous drone. The Terry app works in conjunction with the drone, allowing home owners to be informed the second a potential threat is detected, while also alerting and making neighbours aware of potential threats.</p>

                  <h5> Background Research</h5>
                  <p>The first step was to brainstorm autonomous technologies and what problem areas we wanted to explore. As a group, we decided to focus on autonomous devices, specifically drones through the problem area of home security. We felt that there was huge potential in applying autonomous technology to home security as there aren't many products out there that incorporates autonomous technology with home security. We eventually decided on the scenario 'How can we reduce robberies and increase home security through autonomous technology?'.</p>
<h5> Initial User Testing</h5>
<p>The next step was to conduct user research to understand what the market demands and needs regarding the topic of home security, but also perspectives on innovative autonomous technologies. We decided to conduct the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secondary Research</li>
<li>Surveys/Questionnaires</li>
<li>Interviews</li>
<li>Affinity Diagram and User Journey Maps</li>
</ul>
<P>With our context and scenario of home security in mind, we conducted the following methods and found a range of interesting insights. 
For our survey/questionnaire and interviews, we came up with a range of questions relating to either artificial intelligence and what current home security users have. From this we gained a range of findings:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Visibility is fundamental for a good home security system as it creates an environment that deters criminals eg. visible CCTV camera</li>
<li>68.2% of participants had been previously burgled, with robbers entering their home through open windows, fences and locked doors.</li>
<li>Participants thought artificial intelligence was interesting, good, scary, intimidating, frightening, complicated, unnecessary and futuristic.</li>
<li>45.5% of participants said they would feel safe if their home security was AI based, while 40.9% maybe and 13.6% said no.</li>
<li>Participants felt scared when home alone for reasons such as not being able to defend themselves, strange sounds and due to the fact that it is easier for burglars to rob houses</li>
</ul>

<h5> Synthesis</h5>
<p>After combining our research and insights, we then decided to conduct synthesis methods to help us combine all our data.</p>

                </div>                
              </div>
            </div> 
<p> From our affinity diagram and user journey map, we were able to grasp a better understanding of the thoughts and feelings of users through their experience of home security which were:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Artificial intelligence was very risky and not trustworthy</li>
<li>Some thought it was interesting an innovative</li>
<li>Users thought that in general their home security could be improved, for example they would often forget to lock up their house or turn their alarms on.</li>
</ul>

<p>From these insights, the next step was to identify the most concerning problem area or problem area and start conducting further research and ideation prior to reaching the prototyping stage.
As a team, we decided to focus on people living in houses as we saw more opportunities to create an effective autonomous device compared to an apartment or a share house. 
Thus our initial concepts were based around the idea of 'a presence in the home' in order to scare off burglars.
In order to start coming up with initial ideas, we decided to conduct brainwriting in order to get us thinking quickly that would best suit our problem. Using this method we were able to come up with a range of different concepts and ideas regarding home security. These included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Drone(s) able to protect the home 24/7</li>
<li>Alarm system that can be controlled by voice recognition</li>
<li> Create an autonomous robot that monitors the perimeter of the house</li>
<li>Face recognition sensor at the front door</li>
</ul>
<h5> Initial Concepts</h5>
<p>From this, we were able to come up with four concepts which were an Autonomous Beehive, Romba, Marble Drone and Flower.We then pitched our initial concepts with our tutor however feedback received casted doubt on whether our ideas were realistic enough. We then decided to brainstorm new concepts again as we felt that our previous concepts weren't strong enough to take forward into the prototyping stage. Concept 1 envisioned more focus on the outdoors while Cocnept 2 focused more on the indoors </p>.
<p>After evaluating our two proposed concepts, we decided that we wanted to further iterate on concept 2, as we felt that it best suited our goal of 'a presence in the home' compared to concept 1 which we felt was impractical. We also decided that creating a drone that would be able to deter potential robbers through the implementation of audio and lighting whilst simultaneously monitoring the home was innovative in the methods if secured the home, but also in creating a presence in the home.</p>

<h5> Prototyping Stage</h5>

<p>After deciding to go with concept 1, we decided to further iterate on our concept through the creation of two interfaces for our concept, our first interface would be an app while our second interface would be a smart speaking system.
To assist us with the creation of our two interfaces, we decided to sketch out storyboards to help us envision our future concept and scenarios.
Below show two concepts for future use scenarios:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Scenario 1 envisions Terry as an app interface</li>
<li>Scenario 2 envisions Terry as a smart speaking system</li>
</ol>
                        <div class="row slide-show">
              <div class="col-md-10">
                <div id="carouselExampleIndicators6" class="carousel slide" data-ride="carousel">
                  <ol class="carousel-indicators">
                    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators6" data-slide-to="0" class="active"></li>
                    <li data-target="#carouselExampleIndicators6" data-slide-to="1"></li>
                  </ol>
                  <div class="carousel-inner">
                    <div class="carousel-item active">
                      <img class="d-block w-100" src="./img/process-journal/carousel-images7/storyboard1.JPG?auto=yes&bg=777&fg=555&text=First slide" alt="First slide">

                    </div>
                </div>
                  <a class="carousel-control-prev" href="#carouselExampleIndicators" role="button" data-slide="prev">
                    <span class="carousel-control-prev-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
                  </a>
                  <a class="carousel-control-next" href="#carouselExampleIndicators6" role="button" data-slide="next">
                    <span class="carousel-control-next-icon" aria-hidden="true"></span>
                    <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
                  </a>
                </div>                
              </div>
            </div>   

<p>Next, we decided to start doing low fidelity prototypes of our two interfaces through paper prototyping. Creating low fidelity paper prototypes allowed us to get a greater grasp on what our high fidelity prototype and final design would potentially look like. We then took pictures of all our screens and added them to the mobile application 'Pop' so that we could test our low fidelity prototype.</p>

<p>The app’s main purpose is for it to be a platform of communication between the homeowner and the drone. The app will allow the homeowner to have instant connection with the drone at home so that they can receive live information on any activities that occur in the home.  The aim of this is to raise awareness for neighbors to be wary of their safety and be secure in the home (e.g. a neighbor receives a notification from the app and immediately acts by closing all the windows and doors in their home).</p>

<p>For our second interface, Terry is a smart speaking system (like Siri) that communicates with the user via talking. The smart speaking system will be integrated into any mobile device. Similiarly to the app version, the smart speaking system will have the same features.</p>

                <p> Low Fidelity App Interface</p>
              </div>
            </div>


              
<h5> Low Fidelity User Testing </h5>

<p>To test our low fidelity prototype, we decided to conduct the following methods: Contextual Observation, Think Aloud Method and A/B Testing. To synthesize our data, we evaluated our user feedback from our user testing via nielsons heuristics by establishing which heuristics we violated and solutions to how we can improve our interface. There were several inherent problems that we found, which were:</p>
<ul>
<li>“House map was a bit confusing"</li>
<li>"Need a tutorial or walk through"</li>
<li> “There should be an option to sign out”</li>
<li>“What would happen if you had a pet?”</li>
</ul>
<p>Following our user testing, we then evaluated which interface we felt was more user friendly and appropriate for our concept. After evaluating our feedback from the A/B Testing we established that the app had stronger reasonings in regards to the user’s preferences. This was due to the fact that physically being able to press buttons provided users with more confirmation and that the smart speaking system may not be suitable for certain environments and scenarios. 
Furthermore, after receiving a range of positive and negative feedback, we decided to implement these changes within our Mid Fidelity prototype. To create our mid fidelity prototype, we decided to use Sketch, as we felt it was the simplest and most effective way.</p>

<P>Following the creation of our mid-fidelity prototype, similarly to our low-fidelity prototype, we decided to test our prototype using the same guidelines (except for the A/B Testing). We received a range of mixed feedback that gave our group a lot to consider for the final prototype of our concept. From this, we discovered several things:</P>
<ul>
  <li>“Why is the sign out button in settings?”</li>
<li>“I thought the Help/Search button was a Setting button”</li>
<li>“Adding an entry/exit entry would be convenient”</li>
<li> “I want easier navigation”</li>
<li>“I want more features on the live feed”</li>
</ul>

<p>After testing our concept, and analyzing our feedback, we identified both the strengths and weaknesses of our current design. Some of the weaknesses that were highlighting through our user testing included the positioning of certain elements/features for example a sign out button or a add/plus button. Other complications that were discovered included what would happen when the drone or a smartphone ran out of battery. These user issues will be strongly considered and addressed while progressing onto the next stage of iteration which is creating a high fidelity prototype.</p>

<h5> High Fidelity User Testing </h5>
<p>To create our high fidelity prototype, we decided to use Figma which allowed us to work on the prototype live collaboratively. While creating our high fidelity prototype, we strongly considered the feedback gained from our previous user testing and solved the problems that became apparent. After the completion of the creation of our high fidelity Terry app, we were generally happy with the overall outcome of our application.</p>

<p>Prior to the user testing of our high fidelity prototype, we had decided that we were going to use the following methods: Contextual Observation and the Think Aloud Method.
From our user testing, we received some positive and negative feedback that provided us with great insight on our strengths and weaknesses. Some of the feedback we received were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users wished for more confirmation in the sign up/sign in screens</li>
<li>Users liked the simplicity of the layout</li>
<li>Users enjoyed being able to see the status of their community/neighbors</li>
<li>Users enjoyed the addition of the QR, however they were unsure of how to use it.</li>
<li>The layout of the home screen was simple and easy to understand</li>
<li>However overall users enjoyed the flow and navigation of the app</li>
</ul>
<p>The next step was to analyze our feedback and make the appropriate changes.After considering the range of feedback we received from users, we decided to create more confirmation screens for our processes eg. Our sign up/sign in screens and create an option where users could enlarge their QR code to make it easier when they scan.
Thus, we decided to create our 'Final Prototype' following the feedback we received from our user testing.
</p>

<h5> Final Prototype </h5>

<p>Similarly to the user testing of our first high fidelity prototype, we decided to use the same guidelines.
From our user testing, we received extremely positive feedback, with users liking elements such as the navigation, confirmations screens and hamburger meny. Furthermore, after analyzing our data from our user testing, we realized that there weren't any more changes that could be implemented within our prototype. Thus, the prototype above is our 'Final Prototype'</p>

          <p> During the design process, there were several important design decisions that were made. The first design decision was made during the initial concepts stage when my team came up with four concepts. My group struggled to come up with initial concepts and to tackle this, we decided to complete brainwriting in order for us to come up with concepts. From this, we were able to come up with one or more concepts which centred around autonomous technology, which were:
            <ol>
              <li><b>Autonomous Beehive</b></li>
              <li><b>Autonomous Flower</b></li>
              <li><b>Autonomous Romba</b></li>
              <li><b>Autonomous Marble Drone</b></li>
            </ol>
            <p>Following our intitial concepts, we had to refine our idea to one so proceed to the iteration stage. However while talking to our tutor, we realised that our initial concepts weren't realistic enough to be implemented. Due to this, we had to restart the our concept generation. We then came up with another two concepts which were a lot more refined and realistic, which envisioned an indoor and outdoor security solution. After evaluating our two proposed concepts, we decided that we wanted to further iterate on our indoor concept, as we felt that it best suited our goal of 'a presence in the home' compared to concept 1 which we felt was impractical as we would face numerous problems for example 'what if it starts raining?'. This stage was important as it was the foundation for our final concept and would impact the future direction of our solution. </p>
          <p> Our second design decision was during our low fidelity prototyping stage, in which we were faced with the decision to go with either our app based interface or our smart speaking system interface. Our group felt that both interface designs were extremely relevant and considered combining the two to provide more options for users while using Terry. Following the user testing of our prototype, most of the feedback received pointed towards an app based interface as more users were used to it and provided them with more confirmation. Thus, we decided to further iterate on our app based version for future iterative prototypes as we felt that it was more user friendly than our smart speaking system.</p>
          <p>Overall, we face a myriad of design decisions along our user testing process. Using the positive and negative feedback we received from our users, we were able to accordingly modify our interface to suit the needs of our users. </p>

          <p> Overall, the design process allowed me to get a greater grasp on the steps and methodologies involved while creating a solution. Initially i thought that the process would be more simple and creating a solution would be fast however after completing the project, i now realise the time and effort required to come up with a complex solution. What i learnt was the steps required to come up with a solution, which starts with initial background research into the chosen topic, user testing, analysis, synthesis and repeating the user testing process until the feedback given is generally quite positive.</p>
          <p> Along the process, i was able to apply a range of techniques to assist the creation of our solution which involved research methodologies, synthesis and user testing methods. While researching our initial problem area of home security, we applied a range of research methods such as secondary research, interviews and surveys to get an broad range of data on our topic. For user testing, i applied testing techniques such as contextual observation, A/B testing and think aloud method. Similarly i applied journey maps, affinity diagrams and storyboards to help synthesise the information gained from my user testing.  </p>
          <p>Looking back, i can understand why we were required to perform various tasks and steps to come to our final solution.</p>
